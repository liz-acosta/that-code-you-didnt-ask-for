This is a repository of code for such specific use cases that it's basically useless. (But might be helpful to someone.)

I come from a creative background and as an artist, I am fascinated with the concept of overly complex processes for simple tasks. Rube Goldberg machines. My creative methods are also very messy and nonlinear. Throwing spaghetti at the wall. It's taken me a long time to realize that I can apply these ideas to code. I'm not shipping any of this. I can do whatever I want.

So here's that code you didn't ask for.
